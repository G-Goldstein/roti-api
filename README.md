API middleware for our Rotisserie draft app.

At the moment, this contains a set of mock resources to build onto. Valid endpoints can be found in `resources.py`

Spin this up on Python 3 by grabbing the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then running `python app.py`.

The port to serve on will need Heroku-izing before it can run there.
